# LC-3-isPrime

This is an assembly project I made back when I was studying Computer Science at UVU. I took a course in computer architechure and challenged myself to create a program using the skills that I had learned. The code is heavily commented for anyone who would like to know how it works.

I plan to continue learning assembly, specifically ARM.

## Getting Started

If you would like to run this project: 
1. View the raw assembly code in [prime.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mazjap/LC-3-isPrime/master/prime.txt) and copy it
2. Head over to this [LC-3 Simulator](https://wchargin.github.io/lc3web/) created by [wchargin](https://github.com/wchargin)
3. At the bottom of the page, click the "Assemble" button and paste the code.
4. Hit run

Example output:
```
Enter Hundreds Place Digit (If none, press 0):
Input a character> 9
Enter Tens Place Digit (If none, press 0):
Input a character> 8
Enter Ones Place Digit (If none, press 0):
Input a character> 7
This number is not prime :(

----- Halting the processor -----
